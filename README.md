Hi, I'm Marcin.

Let me tell you a little bit of the history of programming part of my life.

I started my journey through the wonderful world of programming with the C language and plugins for now defunct instant messenger called tlen.pl around 2006.

The C and C ++ have been my companions for quite a few years. They were my languages of first choice every time I started a new project. I even used them on some game jams (- "C++? You won't be able to make a game in 2 days!" - "I won't make it? Hold my beer!") with cocos2d-x library, other times trying new things (like Java with libGDX, C# with speech recognition - yes, we're still talking about game jams).

Speaking about games, I released one in cooperation with 2 other people (a graphic designer and a musician). It was called Scatterfly and I liked it very much, but it wasn't very popular. We started 2 other projects, including one being continuation of the won game jam, but we didn't finish any of them.

There were quite a few things that I tried meanwhile: languages, libraries, IDEs, tools, apps, concepts... Some of them because I wanted to try something new, others because I had no choice (like there was no alternative).

Thanks to my programming skills, I have made life easier for myself and for others. I hate when a human has to do something a computer could do faster, so I made apps and scripts that are automating various things, converters, etc., not only for myself. I like helping others, so when I see someone wasting their time doing something that a machine can do for them, I try to give them a better solution.

And I don't like to pay for something that I could do better. For example I made my own JavaScript app preparing for the driving license theoretical exam. I spent more time programming than learning, but hey, I scored 100% thanks to this app!

I'm not a full time dev (now I wish I was, but I made bad choices in the past) and although I like the idea of free, open source software, I have rarely shown my code so far. I’m not sure it’s good enough.

Now (May 2021) I'm working on some extensions for ERPNext, so I have to use Python (for backend) and JavaScript (for frontend), together with XML, HTML, CSS, JSON and so on.

Mentioned extensions should make ERPNext much more usable in Poland. Vanilla ERPNext doesn't support some basic things like JPK_V7M (standard audit file for tax), uses different money formatting, and so on. I will make them available on github as soon as the basic functionality is ready.

But as I mentioned already, programming is only a part of my life and to be honest: not very big part. 

So what do I do besides programming? I'm a father and business owner (in this order) and these things take up most of my time. I like books (just to mention Pratchett, Gaiman, but also popular science authors like Bill Bryson), music (various, but mainly so called alternative music or indie) and I'm a fan of PlayStation, but have no time to play. In summer I ride an electric unicycle. I like to have my own opinion, so I look for information in various sources so as not to look at the world from one perspective only. I like doing many things myself but at the same time I’m a perfectionist, so I am rarely satisfied with the end result and I can work on everything for too long. I like getting new skills. I wish the days were longer so that I could try more things.

Thanks for reading and have a nice day!
